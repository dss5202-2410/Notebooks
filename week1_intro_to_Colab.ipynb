        "\n",
        "[**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a convenient interactive environment hosted by Google. It is based on Jupyter but does not require installation of Jupyter, or even Python on your machine! You just need Google account to use the service.\n",
        "\n",
        "Colab is a great platform used by data scientist and machine learning programmers. The notebooks are stored in Google Drive, or can be loaded from GitHub.\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, go to the main Colab page (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in using your Google account. Once you are signed in, you will get a pop-up box that looks like this:\n",
